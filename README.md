### Quick Start with Docker

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/battal-algethanin/Filmer.git
cd Filmer
```

#### 2. Start Services
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start PostgreSQL and pgAdmin. The database schema will be automatically initialized.

#### 3. Access pgAdmin
- Open browser: **http://localhost:5050**
- Login credentials are configured in `docker-compose.yml`
- Add server connection using details from `docker-compose.yml`

#### 4. Configure Application
Copy the example environment file and configure your local settings:
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` file with your local database configuration.

#### 5. Run Backend
```bash
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```

#### 6. Run Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## 🔗 End-to-End Connection Test

This section describes how to verify that your full stack is properly connected: **Angular Frontend → Spring Boot Backend → PostgreSQL Database**.

### Prerequisites for Connection Test
Before running the connection test, ensure the following services are running:

1. **PostgreSQL Database** (via Docker):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d postgres
   ```
   - Default hostname: `localhost`
   - Default port: `5432`
   - Database name: `filmer`
   - Username: `postgres`
   - Password: `filmer_dev_password` (as configured in `docker-compose.yaml`)

2. **Spring Boot Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   export DB_URL="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/filmer"
   export DB_USER="postgres"
   export DB_PASSWORD="filmer_dev_password"
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   - Backend runs on: `http://localhost:8080`
   - Health API endpoint: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health`
   - Database connectivity test endpoint: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health/db`

3. **Angular Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   - Frontend runs on: `http://localhost:4200`
   - Angular dev server opens automatically (or navigate manually)

### Running the Connection Test

Once all three services are running:

1. Open your browser and navigate to: **http://localhost:4200**
2. Click on the **"Connection Test"** link in the navigation menu
3. Click the **"Test Connection"** button

### Expected Results

**Success Scenario:**
- Frontend displays: ✅ **Connection Successful!**
- You'll see a JSON response from the backend containing:
  - `success`: `true`
  - `database_status`: `"UP"`
  - `result`: `1` (from the SELECT 1 query)
  - `message`: `"Database connection successful"`

**Failure Scenarios:**

| Issue | Symptom | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| PostgreSQL not running | Error: "Cannot connect to backend" or "Database connection failed (503)" | Run `docker-compose up -d postgres` |
| Backend not running | Error: "Cannot connect to backend server. Is it running on http://localhost:8080?" | Run `mvn spring-boot:run` in backend folder |
| CORS configuration error | Error: "Access to XMLHttpRequest blocked by CORS policy" | CORS is already configured in backend (src/main/java/com/filmer/config/CorsConfig.java) |
| Environment variables not set | Backend runs but cannot connect to database | Set environment variables: DB_URL, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD |

### Test Endpoint Details

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/health/db`

**Purpose:** Tests database connectivity by executing a simple `SELECT 1` query

**Request:**
```http
GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health/db
```

**Success Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "success": true,
    "result": 1,
    "message": "Database connection successful",
    "database_status": "UP"
  }
}
```

**Failure Response (503 Service Unavailable):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "DB_CONNECTION_ERROR",
    "message": "Database connection failed"
  }
}
```

### Troubleshooting Connection Issues

1. **Check Docker Services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   # Should show postgres and pgadmin as "Up"
   ```

2. **Verify Database is Accessible:**
   ```bash
   docker exec -it filmer-postgres psql -U postgres -d filmer -c "SELECT 1"
   # Should return: 1
   ```

3. **Check Backend is Running:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health
   # Should return: {"success":true,"data":{"status":"UP","database":"UP",...}}
   ```

4. **Check Frontend Network Requests:**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Navigate to the Network tab
   - Click "Test Connection" button
   - Look for the request to `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health/db`
   - Check the response tab for details

5. **View Backend Logs:**
   ```bash
   # Just look at the terminal where you ran: mvn spring-boot:run
   # You should see SQL queries being executed and connection events
   ```

### Next Steps

Once the connection test is successful:
- ✅ Your development environment is properly configured
- ✅ Frontend ↔ Backend communication is working
- ✅ Backend ↔ Database communication is working
- You can now proceed to implement and test application features

### 🛠️ Docker Commands Reference

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Stop all services (keeps data)
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove all data (fresh start)
docker-compose down -v

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# View PostgreSQL logs only
docker-compose logs -f postgres

# Restart services
docker-compose restart

# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# Access PostgreSQL CLI directly
docker exec -it filmer-postgres psql -U postgres -d filmer
```

---

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

**Issue:** `Port 5432 is already in use`  
**Solution:** You have PostgreSQL running locally. Either:
- Stop local PostgreSQL: `net stop postgresql-x64-15` (Windows)
- Change Docker port in `docker-compose.yml`: `"5433:5432"`

**Issue:** `Port 5050 is already in use`  
**Solution:** Change pgAdmin port in `docker-compose.yml`: `"5051:80"`

**Issue:** Docker containers won't start  
**Solution:** 
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```

**Issue:** Can't connect to database from Spring Boot  
**Solution:** Verify environment variables are set correctly and match docker-compose.yml

**Issue:** Schema tables not created  
**Solution:** 
```bash
# Recreate database with schema
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```

### 📋 Development Checklist

Before starting development, ensure:
- [x] Docker Desktop is installed and running
- [x] `docker-compose up -d` executed successfully
- [x] pgAdmin accessible at http://localhost:5050
- [x] Database `filmer` visible in pgAdmin with 9 tables
- [x] Environment variables configured (`.env` file or IDE)
## Useful Commands

### Docker
```bash
docker-compose up -d          # Start services
docker-compose down           # Stop services
docker-compose down -v        # Stop and remove data
docker-compose logs -f        # View logs
docker-compose ps             # Check status
```

### Development
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## Troubleshooting

**Port conflicts**: If ports 5432 or 5050 are in use, modify port mappings in `docker-compose.yml`

**Database connection issues**: Verify environment variables match `docker-compose.yml` configuration

**Schema not loading**: Run `docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up -d` to reset database

---

## Environment Configuration

**Important:** This project uses environment variables for sensitive configuration. Never commit credentials, API keys, or secrets to GitHub.

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with your local database configuration:
```
DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/filmer
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` and will not be committed to the repository.

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy
- Each team member works on their own development branch
- All changes must be submitted via Pull Requests (PRs)
- PRs require at least two reviewer approvals before merging
- Direct commits to main branch are blocked

### Code Quality
- All code must pass automated tests before merging
- GitHub Actions run linting, formatting, and testing checks
- Follow clean code principles and proper documentation
- All API endpoints must be documented with request/response formats

## Testing

This project includes comprehensive test coverage:
- **Unit Tests**: Backend services and frontend components
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints and database operations
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Response time and load testing

Run tests before submitting any PR:
```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
mvn test

# Frontend tests
cd frontend
npm test
```
